Description
-----------

This is basically just my test project for OpenGL. It's currently mostly a shader pipeline, with support for loading Wavefront Object (.OBJ) files.

Dependencies
------------

- OpenGL (with 3.3+ support)
- SDL 2
- Bullet 2.82+ (Edit the BULLET variable in the makefile to point to local headers before compiling)
